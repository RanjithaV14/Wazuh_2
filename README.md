🔔 Proud to Share Another Milestone in My Cybersecurity Journey!
In my latest hands-on project at Infotact Solutions, I demonstrated how the Wazuh SIEM platform detects and blocks real-time network attacks.
🛡️ The attacks I simulated and captured include:
 ✅ ICMP Ping Flood Attack
 ✅ SSH Brute Force Attack
Using Kali Linux to simulate attacks and Wazuh for monitoring, I explored how important real-time detection, alerting, and response are in cybersecurity operations.
Every step — from attack simulation to alert analysis — strengthened my skills in:
 🔹 Network traffic monitoring
 🔹 Threat hunting
 🔹 Incident response automation
I’m grateful for the continuous learning opportunities and excited to keep building deeper expertise in cybersecurity! 🚀
Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback on the video. 🎥👇
